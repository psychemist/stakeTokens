# Stake Tokens

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with two contracts for staking Ether and ERC20 tokens, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys the contracts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.ts
```
